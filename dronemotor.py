# This program will let you test your ESC and brushless motor.
# Make sure your battery is not connected if you are going to calibrate it at first.
# Since you are testing your motor, I hope you don't have your propeller attached to it otherwise you are in trouble my friend...?
# This program is made by AGT @instructable.com. DO NOT REPUBLISH THIS PROGRAM... actually the program itself is harmful                                             pssst Its not, its safe.
